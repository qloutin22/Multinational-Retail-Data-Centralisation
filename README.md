Description
The Retail Data Centralisation/Data Extraction project aims to centralise and streamline the extraction of retail data from various sources. It provides a robust system to gather data from multiple retail outlets, analyse it, and present insights for informed decision-making. The primary objectives include:

Developing an efficient data extraction mechanism from diverse retail systems.
Centralising data to a unified database or data warehouse for easy access and analysis.
Implementing tools for data cleansing, transformation, and visualization.
Enabling stakeholders to derive actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
Throughout the project, several key learnings were attained, including data integration techniques, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, database management, data cleaning SQL and Python. Understanding retail-specific data challenges and developing scalable solutions were integral parts of the learning process.
